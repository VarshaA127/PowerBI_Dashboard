# PowerBI_Dashboard Customer Churn Analysis

I am working on Customer Churn analysis Dashboard using a telecom dataset.
I am using Power query editor, different charts like bar, stack, donut chart, gauge, slicer, zoom slider, line chart, dax queries, & a lot more..


I am majorly trying to focus on the insights that can be driven out of the churning customers, the type of services they use & payment related other details.


Dashboard coming soon !!
